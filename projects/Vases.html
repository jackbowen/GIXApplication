      <p class="projectDescription">New Alchemy is an ongoing series of vases and candelabras I make out of my home shop. Each one is made to a client’s specific requirements so the size and shape can vary greatly between each one. Their cost is a function of the raw materials and the labor hours each one takes to make. I don’t charge for designing the piece itself. The majority of my clientele has been pretty affluent but there’s a growing interest in a more economical version of what I’ve been making. For the more expensive pieces, I can write off the time it takes to first design and model them. For a more affordable version of these, my profit margins would be too thin to do this. I’m using simple hand tools to make these so a standardized design wouldn’t do too much to cut production costs and I’d like to continue to configure them to each client’s needs. What follows is my process for developing a tool for clients to generate designs for a simplified version of these pieces.</p>
