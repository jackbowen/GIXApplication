      <p class="projectDescription">New Alchemy is an ongoing series of vases and candelabras I make out of my home shop. Each one is made to a client’s specific requirements so the size and shape can vary greatly between each one. Their cost is a function of the raw materials and the labor hours each one takes to make. I don’t charge for designing the piece itself. The majority of my clientele has been pretty affluent but there’s a growing interest in a more economical version of what I’ve been making. For the more expensive pieces, I can write off the time it takes to first design and model them. For a more affordable version of these, my profit margins would be too thin to do this. I’m using simple hand tools to make these so a standardized design wouldn’t do too much to cut production costs and I’d like to continue to configure them to each client’s needs. What follows is my process for developing a tool for clients to generate designs for a simplified version of these pieces.</p>

      <div id="base-creator-holder">
        <!-- baseCreator.js canvas will go here! -->
      </div>

      <p class="projectDescription">The user begins by specifying the dimensions of the base for their piece. A slider labeled “wiggliness” introduces more and more Perlin noise into the shape. Once a user has a shape that they like, they press the button to lock it in. The normal version of this software simply moves a few steps ahead on the same display but to demonstrate the process a little bit better I’ve broken it up into a few sketches. Proceed below.</p>

      <div id="flock-holder">
        <!-- baseFlock.js canvas will go here! -->
      </div>

      <p class="projectDescription">The above sketch and the one that follows it are normally combined into one step but I thought it would be interesting to break out the flocking behaviour demonstrated in the one above. At this point the user is specifying how many candles or flowers their piece will hold. We want to distribute these elements in a painterly way so we need to bake a little bit of intelligence into each one. To do this there are three rules that each one follows. First, they wander about randomly. A vector showing this random movement has been drawn in red for each element. Second, they want to avoid the edges and stay within the base we defined in the previous step. Whenever an element reaches a certain distance from the edge, it accelerates away from it by analyzing all the points that make up the shape, figuring out which pair of sequential points it is closest to, and steering along a vector that is perpendicular to the line made up by those two points. When this occurs, we display the section of base edge we are steering away from as well as the normal vector that the element is accelerating along in green. Third, we want the elements to separate from each other. Each element looks at all the other elements to do this. If any other element is less than a specified distance, we accelerate away from it. If multiple elements are within the specified distance then their effect is weighted by their respective distances. These relationships are drawn in blue.</p> 

      <div id="axon-holder">
        <!-- axonView.js canvas will go here! -->
      </div>

      <p class="projectDescription">The above sketch allows users to specify the maximum height of their piece. As elements get farther out from the center their respective heights decrease. Their heights vary within a small range that’s a function from their distance to the center so as not to appear too uniform. At this point we also draw the tubes on the tops of the rods that will hold our candles or vials for flowers. The program generates a real time cost to build the piece based on the amount of raw material and the time it would take to construct. The raw material is a function of the area of the base and total length of all the rods and tubes that make up the piece. The labor is a function of the circumference of the base and how many cuts and welds it would take to make. Once a user clicks add to cart they can see a revolved version of their piece before confirming their design. At this point the program generates a vector file and bill of materials for me to work from. I currently spend about 20-30% of the time each piece takes to make going back and forth with a client without billing for those hours. This software will augment my production moving forward in a way that improves my profitability and reduces the administerial aspect of freelancing that I don’t really care for. It also serves as a proof of concept for a kind of boutique manufacturing that I wish to continue working on.</p>
